The R-shiy app serves multiple purposes, and offers the following features: 

>- **Squad/Player Analytics** : The most fundemental feature, this part of the app allows a user to view data for a perticular club (player) for a specific season. 
The detailed data is segrated according to the possibles roles a personel takes on the feild, these include '__Attack__', '__Defense__', '__Advance__' (general term for what is commany called midfild) '__Fair Play__', '__General__' (Only for player specific analysis, includes statistics of the players apperances and time spent on the feild.) and '__Win Loss__' (Only for club specific analysis, mainly includes the final league stading of the league for that perticuler season.)
The user will be promted to select a season, league, a club or a player and then the kind of statistics he is intrested in. 

>- **Player Comparison** The app facilitates visual comparision of upto 3 players for a given season. The comparisions can be again made according to the the roles which a player can take up, as detailed above.
An intresting note to make is that the since the app allows a user to choose any player Irrespective of his position in the squad and the kind of statistic to compare the players, It is possible to make Unorthodox comparisons, like comparing the defensive actions of 2 center forwards, Since they could also be expected to perform defensive duties incase the they are playing with 10 pairs of foots on the feild.
